ajax into session storage

## overview
I am familiar with ajax-ing to upload data into a database, but what if I just wanted to persist for browser session instead of using a database? Well, here it is. Named it project Sunday because, well, I made it on a Sunday.

Uses html, php, jquery, and ajax to pull simple form data, add to session storage.

Not much to look at, but that can be done later. I was more interested in tinkering to find a way to just do it. Add some items and then refresh the page to see how it 'hangs around'

## future capabilities
1. clear session button
2. save/delete to cookie for long term storage
3. do some math on the data, manipulate
4. style it out to look better
5. send user alerts when item added?

## comments, suggestions, changes
I am more than happy to receive critiques, comments on my code. Thank you!
